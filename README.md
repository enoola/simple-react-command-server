# the project
simple server, to quickly handles various command of your choice
the whole idea is that I will checkout the project as base for another one

```

## Setup

clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/enoola/simple-react-command-server.git

```
You probably want to
1. rename the folder to your new project name for example
`cd simple-react-command-server` or `cd "the new folder name"`
2. change this to your git project
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.git
#shall work for gitlab which I do not use atm
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Environment variables
we use variable from .env.local file
which contains non sensible values such as hostname, port

1. Copy .env file to .env.local, 
`cp .env .env.local`

2. Open `.env.local` and update with your values
e.g:
```env
HTTP_FQDN=localhost
HTTP_SERVER_PORT=3000
```

### Install npm package
`npm install`

### Launch the project
#### fastest way from 1 terminal
we use the below
`npm run dev`
which ultimately launches : `nodemon --watch src --exec myworkmaterial/watch_transpile_relaunchwebserv.sh`
cf: https://nodemon.io/

#### Watch then nodemon 2 terminal required
### Retranspile if file changes in the server folder src
`npm run watch`

### Automatically restart the server if file changes
`npm run dev2steps`

## Using the project 
at that point the server should be launched
`npm run dev`

### Query server wuth curl command line tool 
  I assume you have curl installed, if not look at the "From a browser" section
We know the server is accessible by querying : `http://{HTTP_SERVER_FQDN}:{HTTP_SERVER_PORT}/`
  Remember editing `.env.local` file, well time to remember those value 
  from my values, mentionned before:
    ```env
    HTTP_SERVER_FQDN='localhost'
    HTTP_SERVER_PORT=3000
    ```
I will refer to server URL as http://localhost:3000
Open a terminal, and type the following commands, first line of each block.
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
{"error":"404","message":"Woop woop, Curious you"}
```

Hello
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/hello
{"message":"Hello world!"}
```

we will query searchweb function

Finaly we use exec function to list local folder (don't do this irl )
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ls
{"output":["coverage","dist","jest.config.ts","myworkmaterial","node_modules","nodemon.json","package-lock.json","package.json","project_export.txt","README.md","src","tsconfig.json",""]}
```
### From a browser
Open a browser (or browser tab),
Remember editing `.env.local file`, well time to remember those value 
Go to `http://{HTTP_SERVER_FQDN:HTTP_SERVER_PORT}/`
from my values, mentionned before:
for me server adress is : http://localhost:3000

if you query `http://localhost:3000` you will get an error message
{"error":"404","message":"Woop woop, Curious you"}

http://localhost:3000/api/hello

you can add your search I've used "1984 book visionary"
http://localhost:3000/searchweb/1984 book visionary

http://localhost:3000/searchweb
